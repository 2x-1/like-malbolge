# like-malbolge
A bit of an experiment of a 8080 like machine code language, with ideas taken from Malbolge
## Registers
`C`, `A`, `D, `E`, `B`, `F`, `SP`...
## Instruction decoding
Decoded as `(C+[C])%96`.
### Instruction set
The instructions set is intentionally kept very sparse to ease programming.
